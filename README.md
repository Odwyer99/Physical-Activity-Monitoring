# Physical-Activity-Monitoring

The goal of this report is to develop hardware and/or software which can determine the
amount (using start/end times and heart rates) and type of physical activity carried out by
an individual, and to also determine the actionable insights that are derivable from the
dataset.

The dataset used for this project is Physical Activity Monitoring dataset "PAMAP2",
an activity monitoring dataset that contains 18 different physical activities that were
performed by 9 different subjects â€” eight men and one woman wearing 3 inertial
measurement units and a heart rate monitor. The data is stored in individual text files per
subject. Each row in each file represents one reading and contains 54 attributes
(including timestamp, activity ID, heart rate and IMU sensory data).

Specific Requirements for Project

1. Carry out thorough exploratory data analysis and appropriately handle missing or
dirty data;
2. Develop and test at least one hypothesis for a relationship between a single pair of
attributes;
3. Develop and test at least one model which uses multiple attributes to make
predictions
